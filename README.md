# P2_project
Repository for our P2 project

Setup server - in terminal:
npm init -y
npm i express 
npm i csv-parser
npm i --save-dev nodemon

Languages: 
Java Script, C, HTML and CSS

How to start and stop the program: 
    Requirements:
        Windows OS
        Node installed

    Start by opening up the terminal in the P2_PROJECT folder 
    This can be done in the two following ways:
        [1] right click the folder and press open in terminal
        [2] navigate your folders in the terminal with "cd [foldername]" to go forward
            or "cd.." to go back.

    When trying to run the program for the first time, node has to be initialized. 
    This is done by typing the folowing lines into the terminal (this can take some time,
    however, it is only neccesary once)
        "npm init -y"
        "npm i express"
        "npm i csv-parser"
        "npm i --save-dev nodemon"

    When node has been set up, the server can be started with "node server.js"
    The server will then provide you with a link to the localhost:4000 page.
    The link can be copied, or clicked on with "ctrl + left_click".

    When you are done with interacting with the server, you must press "ctrl + c" in the terminal
    to stop it

Once you have opened the program, how do you operate the program: 
    The first you will see when clicking the link is the front page
    from here you are free to navigate to any of the sites in the hotbar to the left

    Feel free to use these log in id's 
        Admin: 12345
        Student: 54321

    When on the Admin page or the Student page, you can always navigate back to the front page
    by clicking the arrow in the top left corner.
